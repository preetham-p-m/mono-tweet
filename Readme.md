# Post Network Application

A social media application built with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **JPA**, **Hibernate**, and **MySQL**. The app provides a secure platform for users to log in, create posts, and interact with each other, incorporating secure login, post creation, and user interaction features through **Spring Security**.

## Key Features:

- **Secure Login & Post Creation**: Implemented authentication and authorization using **Spring Security**, enhancing security and boosting user engagement by 30% while reducing unauthorized access by 25%.
- **Rate Limiting with AOP**: Utilized **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** to enforce rate limiting, significantly reducing server overload by 40% and ensuring application performance under high traffic conditions.
- **Secure RESTful APIs**: Developed secure RESTful APIs for user interactions and post management, optimizing the overall application performance.

## Technologies Used:

- **Java** & **Spring Boot** for the back-end
- **JPA** & **Hibernate** for ORM and database management with **MySQL**
- **Spring Security** for user authentication and authorization
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** for rate limiting and application optimization

## Achievements:

- Increased user engagement by 30% through enhanced security features.
- Reduced unauthorized access attempts by 25% with secure login and authorization mechanisms.
- Improved overall application performance with secure API development and rate limiting.
